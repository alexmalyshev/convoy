This is a collection of data structures/types written in C89.

Every folder in src/ is a separate data structure that will contain a header
file and a source file of the same name as the folder (e.g. folder rbtree
contains rbtree.h and rbtree.c).

None of the data structures depend upon each other, so feel free to just pull
out a folder and use it.
