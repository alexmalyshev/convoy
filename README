This is a collection of data structures/types written in C89.

Every folder in src/ is a separate data structure that will contain a header
file and a source file of the same name as the folder (e.g. folder rbtree
contains rbtree.h and rbtree.c).

None of the data structures depend upon each other, so feel free to just pull
out a folder and use it.

All files in the src/ folder are released under the terms listed in the
LICENSE file found in the top level convoy folder (3-clause BSD license).

Detailed documentation can be found in the docs/ folder courtesy of doxygen.
