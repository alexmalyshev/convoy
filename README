--Everything in this repository is in the public domain--

This is a collection of data structures/types written in ANSI C.

Every folder is a separate data structure that will contain a header
file of the same name as the folder (e.g. folder rbtree contains file
rbtree.h). This is the only #include needed in your code, simply
compile with the same-named .c file in the compiler arg list and you're
good to go. If the folder also has a "-int.h" file, simply have that
in the same folder that you are compiling in. You do not need to
#include it.
